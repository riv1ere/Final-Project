    "## Introduction\n",
    "In an era of less face-to-face interaction with increasing digital connectivity, the sense of community fostered by public spaces and gatherings gradually fades. Community Centers are one avenue of preservation nonetheless -- being public venues for socialization and recreational activity, their active function within a neighborhood can signify a close-knit community. Here, we seek to analyze the distribution of these centers as well as their respective attendance counts as a metric of community."
